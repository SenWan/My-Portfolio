            <h3>Hi, I'm Sen Wan</h3>
            <p>I'm an independent web developer, writer, and speaker. I'm also the fellow who started that whole “responsive design” thing.If you'd like, you can read more about me. But my journal's where I jot down thoughts about digital design, technology, and everything else under the sun.
            Thanks for visiting. It's nice to meet you.</p>

            <h2>The Work I do</h2>
            <p>Over the years, I've worked with clients like People Magazine, The Sundance Film Festival, and The Boston Globe. Together, we've created beautiful responsive websites, improved their design systems, and created faster, more accessible products. If that sounds like a project you're working on, drop me a line and let's work on it together.Looking for more strategic help? I recently cofounded Autogram with Karen McGrane and Jeff Eaton, where we work on big, tangly problems involving content management and design systems.</p>

                <h1>Full Stack Web Developer</h1>
                <p>A full-stack developer is proficient in working with both front-end and back-end coding languages. With their diverse skill set, they are able to work on every step of the web development process, including prototyping and programming browsers, servers, and databases. Often graduates of our Bootcamp continue their learning journeys with us by studying to become full-stack developers, so that they can level up to more senior roles at their company.</p>
